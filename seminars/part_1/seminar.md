## Seminar 1

These are the instructions for the first seminar. Before the seminar you will work with wireshark to analyse a number of files containing caputered network traffic. At the seminar you will discuss your findings.

### Analysing the capture files

These are the files you will work can be found in this [ZIP archive](https://cdn.rawgit.com/1dv031/syllabus/master/seminars/part_1/captures/capturefiles.zip). Each file contains some communication to be analysed.

For each file, try to answer the following questions:

1. What protocols are used in the communication?
2. At what layer of the OSI (or TCP/IP) model do they operate?
3. What RFC(s) (if any) will help us learn more about this protocol?
4. What is the purpose of the protocol (according to the RFC if you found any)?
5. Who are the communicating parties at each layer (focus on addresses)?
6. How are they related to one another?
