## Alternative to seminar 2

This assignment will be a bigger written assignment. The assignment will have the same questions as the original assignment but with a extra task. The answers to the below questions will be presented in a written report.

1. Answer the same questions as in the [original seminar](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/systemadministrationi/part-2-server-operation-methods/seminar/). Be sure to make good and deep explanations. (ca 1000-1500 words)
2. You should do some own investigations among the cloud service providers of Microsoft Azure and Amazon. It is always interesting to estimate how much a infrastructure of servers will cost before it is running in the cloud and you will try to do this for a given scenario. Your task is to try to estimate the cost for a company that wants to put there infrastructure in the cloud. The infrastructure includes:
  - 2 DNS servers
  - 3 Database servers (running mariaDB or mySQL)
  - 2 Web servers (running apache + PHP)
  - 1 cache server (running redis)

Try to explain and motivate the requirement for the different services, what operating system and so on. Also try to estimate the monthly cost for this setup.

Answers to all questions should be written down in a report (Swedish or English) and saved in PDF-format. This report should be send to the course-email: 1dv031@lnu.se
