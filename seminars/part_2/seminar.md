### Seminar questions

1. What does it mean?
2. How does it work?
3. Give examples of companies or products for the topic, no more then three.
4. How does it relate to the other topics in the same level, for example: Hypervisor vs. Kernel-Level or Physical vs. Virtual vs. Container?
5. Are there different kind and how do they differentiate from one another?
6. What is the advantages/disadvantages?


### Presenting the findings at the seminar

At the seminar we will discuss your findings from the questions above. Since there are 9x6 questions and five members to each seminar group, some questions will probably be left out - but you cannot tell which before hand so you should be able to answer the questions above. Remember that a constructive contribution to the discussion is more important than "being right".

A few pointers:

* Make your voice heard - participation is mandatory and participation means contributing to the discussion.
* Listen to what the other participants say, think about it and then deliver your reaction.
* When one questions seems answered, try to find a "natural" way into the next questions.
* If you are a person who usually talks a lot, please be observant and try to figure out who is not talking - invite that person into the conversation (that is a positive contribution to the discussion on your part).
* If you are a person who usually is quiet and do not talk, see the first point above.
