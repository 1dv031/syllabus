## Presenting the findings at the seminar

At the seminar we will discuss your findings from the questions above. Since there are a lot of questions and five members to each seminar group, some questions will probably be left out - but you cannot tell which before hand so you should be able to answer the questions above. Remember that a constructive contribution to the discussion is more important than "being right".

A few pointers:

* Make your voice heard - participation is mandatory and participation means contributing to the discussion.
* Listen to what the other participants say, think about it and then deliver your reaction.
* When one questions seems answered, try to find a "natural" way into the next questions.
* If you are a person who usually talks a lot, please be observant and try to figure out who is not talking - invite that person into the conversation (that is a positive contribution to the discussion on your part).
* If you are a person who usually is quiet and do not talk, see the first point above.
