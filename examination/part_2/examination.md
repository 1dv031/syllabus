Below are the instructions for the written examinations. Please note that you need to complete both the seminars and the written examinations to pass the course.

## Examination 2 - Server operation methods
For this examination you are expected to produce a written report of between 1500-2000 words. Report should be delivered to the course email address, [1dv031@lnu.se](mailto:1dv031@lnu.se), as a PDF no later than **10:00AM [CEST] April 13th**. Please note that the report should be written in **Swedish**.

### Content of the report
The starting point for the report is the work already done for the seminar. At the seminar you presented your findings about how and where you can run you applications. In the report you will analyze our different scenarios and come to a recommendation of how and where these scenarios should be run.  The report should contain four parts (but the parts do not need separate headings):

1. The first part should be an **introduction** to the four scenarios. What is the scenario about, what demands does it have?
2. The second part will be a background or **theory** about the different ways to run applications in general. This work should already be done if you have completed the seminar, you will then only need to summarize your findings.
3. Now knowing what the problem is, introduction, and different ways to solve the problem, theory, you will now **analyze** the scenarios. What theory is good/bad for the scenario, don't come to a conclusion here that is the final step.
4. **Conclusion** - Here you will make you recommendation based on your analysis.

<br/>
### Scenarios
Four different customers have contacted you for a recommendation. <br />

#### The companies
1. **A startup company** - This is a typical web startup company with a web application as a product. The company is expecting to expand big time in the coming months and will have a commercial campaign soon that will drive lots of users to there web application. The main office is in Stockholm but the application is worldwide with big markets in North America and Asia.

2. **Swedish state authority** (Svensk statlig myndighet) - This customer stores sensible personal data and have big demands on availability and security.

3. **Media bank** - This is a company that store media files for its customers. They are focusing on images, videos and other big data files. They have a slogan - "Safe, available and fast"

4. **IT consultant** - This company develops web applications for its customers (among other things). The company develops web solutions for different customers and also have the responsibility to operate/maintain the applications. Today they have about 100 different applications and expect thats the volume the five coming years.

<br />
The customer doesn't always think about everything, it's you job to find these things and point them out to the customer. Here are some topics that the customer might have forgotten:

* Security
* Performance
* Scalability
* Availability
* Localization

<br />
### Some tips

* Spell check! And if possible grammar check!
* Remember: this is a story even if the form is not that of a fairy tale or a novel. Think about your narrative and style!
* Read it out loud. If it is hard for you to read, it is probably hard for someone else.
* Let some else read it and get their feedback on the content, the language and the narrative.
* Remember that the person examining your report might have read 10-15 report before s/he comes to yours - how do you make your report stand out?!
* Keep within the limits!
* Make sure to make references to the course literature and any other literature that is relevant for your topic.
* Use a [recognized system](https://lnu.se/en/library/Writing-and-referencing/referencing/) ([SWE](https://lnu.se/ub/skriva-och-referera/skriva-referenser/)) for incorporating references in your text.

## The peer-review instructions
In this course we will use so-called peer-review, the Swedish also called "referensgranskning". This means in short that you will study an other studentÂ´s written reports. The idea of the step is to demonstrate your knowledge by analyzing and providing feedback on other student's assignments and hopefully also get great feedback on your own. This dose not mean that you should grade each other rather push and give each other good feedback. In addition, it is important to be able to rise from your own bubble and reflect on the work of others.

1. After the submission deadline, **10:00AM [CEST] April 13th**, you will get an e-mail with another students report.
2. Read and analyze the report and give feedback, no more then **300 words.**
3. Send your feedback to the [course email address](mailto:1dv031@lnu.se) and a copy to the student who wrote the report, no later than **08:00AM [CEST] April 19th**
