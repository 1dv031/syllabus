For this examination you are expected to produce a written report of between 1500-2000 words.

### Content of the report
In the report you will analyze our different scenarios and come to a recommendation of how and where these scenarios should be run.  The report should contain four parts:

1. The first part should be an **introduction** to the three scenarios. What is the scenario about, what demands does it have?
2. The second part will be a background or **theory** about the different ways to run applications in general. This work should partly be done if you have completed the seminar.
3. Now knowing what the problem is, introduction, and different ways to solve the problem, theory, you will now **analyze** the scenarios. What is good/bad for the different scenarios, don't come to a conclusion here that is the final step.
4. **Conclusion** - Here you will make you recommendation based on your analysis.

### Some tips

* Spell check! And if possible grammar check!
* Remember: this is a story even if the form is not that of a fairy tale or a novel. Think about your narrative and style!
* Read it out loud. If it is hard for you to read, it is probably hard for someone else.
* Let some else read it and get their feedback on the content, the language and the narrative.
* Remember that the person examining your report might have read 10-15 report before s/he comes to yours - how do you make your report stand out?!
* Keep within the limits!
* Make sure to make references to the course literature and any other literature that is relevant for your topic.
* Use a [recognized system](https://lnu.se/en/library/Writing-and-referencing/referencing/) ([SWE](https://lnu.se/ub/skriva-och-referera/skriva-referenser/)) for incorporating references in your text.

## The peer-review instructions
In this course we will use so-called peer-review, the Swedish also called "referensgranskning". This means in short that you will study an other student´s written reports. The idea of the step is to demonstrate your knowledge by analyzing and providing feedback on other student's assignments and hopefully also get great feedback on your own. This dose not mean that you should grade each other rather push and give each other good feedback. In addition, it is important to be able to rise from your own bubble and reflect on the work of others.

1. After the submission deadline, **10:00AM [CEST] April 13th**, you will get an e-mail with another students report.
2. Read and analyze the report and give feedback, no more then **300 words.**
3. Send your feedback to the [course email address](mailto:1dv031@lnu.se) and a copy to the student who wrote the report, no later than **08:00AM [CEST] April 19th**
