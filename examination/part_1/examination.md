### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! ANYTHING WRITTEN HERE MIGHT BE CHANGED AS LONG AS THIS TEXT IS ON THE TOP

Below are the instructions for the written examinations. Please note that you need to complete both the seminars and the written examinations to pass the course.

## Examination 1 - Computer Networks

For this examination you are expected to produce a written report of between 800-1000 words. Report should be delivered to the course email address as a PDF no later than <!-- PLEASE ADD DATE HERE -->.

### Content of the report

The starting point for the report is the work already done for the seminar. At the seminar you presented your findings and in the report you will describe what you have done and what you have learned. The report should contain three parts (but the parts do not need separate headings):

1. The first part should be an introduction to the text. Here you present the theme of the report in a way that captures the reader and makes her/him want to continue reading. Remember that the person examining your report might have read 10-15 report before s/he comes to yours - how do you make your report stand out?!

2. Once the introductions are over you should go into detail about how you went about your work. What did you do? How? Why? Here you can present central tools, references and descriptions of your methods and your rational behind choosing them.

3. In this last part you present what you have learned from working with this exercise, including the seminar.

### Some tips

* Spell check! And if possible grammar check!
* Remember: this is a story even if the form is not that of a fairy tale or a novell. Think about your narrative and style!
* Read it out loud. If it is hard for you to read, it is probably hard for someone else.
* Let some else read it and get their feedback on the content, the language and the narrative.
* Keep within the limits!
* Make sure to make references to the course litterature and any other literature that is relevant for your topic.
* Use a [recogniced system](https://lnu.se/en/library/Writing-and-referencing/referencing/) ([SWE](https://lnu.se/ub/skriva-och-referera/skriva-referenser/)) for incorporating references in your text.
