Below are the instructions for the written examinations. Please note that you need to complete both the seminars, the written examinations and peer review reports to pass the course.

## Examination 1 - Computer Networks

For this examination you are expected to produce a written report of between 800-1000 words. The report should be published on internet (preferably as a Google Doc) as a PDF no later than **18:00 March 30th**. Please note that the report should be written in **English**. Put the URL to the report in this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uATMAwxdPm9tbzKcopdJ-HLte7VGXkgEjjEyTN5UgIc/edit#gid=1498161455)

### Content of the report

The starting point for the report is the work already done for the seminar. At the seminar you presented your findings and in the report you will describe what you have done and what you have learned. The report should contain three parts (but the parts do not need separate headings):

1. The first part should be an introduction to the text. Here you present the theme of the report in a way that captures the reader and makes her/him want to continue reading. Remember that the person examining your report might have read 10-15 report before s/he comes to yours - how do you make your report stand out?!

2. Once the introductions are over you should go into detail about how you went about your work. What did you do? How? Why? Here you can present central tools, references and descriptions of your methods and your rational behind choosing them.

3. In this last part you present what you have learned from working with this exercise, including the seminar.

### Some tips

* Spell check! And if possible grammar check!
* Remember: this is a story even if the form is not that of a fairy tale or a novel. Think about your narrative and style!
* Read it out loud. If it is hard for you to read, it is probably hard for someone else.
* Let some else read it and get their feedback on the content, the language and the narrative.
* Keep within the limits!
* Make sure to make references to the course literature and any other literature that is relevant for your topic.
* Use a [recognized system](https://lnu.se/en/library/Writing-and-referencing/referencing/) ([SWE](https://lnu.se/ub/skriva-och-referera/skriva-referenser/)) for incorporating references in your text.
* We will run your report through the anti plagiarism system Urkund. **Do not copy text from other student's reports nor from any other documents!**

### The peer-review instructions
In this course we will use so-called peer-review, the Swedish also called "referensgranskning". This means in short that you will study another studentÂ´s written reports. The idea of the step is to demonstrate your knowledge by analysing and providing feedback on other student's assignments and hopefully also get great feedback on your own. This does not mean that you should grade each other rather push and give each other good feedback. In addition, it is important to be able to rise from your own bubble and reflect on the work of others.

1. After the submission deadline, **18:00 March 30th**, we will add information in the spreadsheet about what report your should review.
2. Read and analyse the report allocated to you and give feedback, no more then 300 words
3. Submit the URL to the review in [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uATMAwxdPm9tbzKcopdJ-HLte7VGXkgEjjEyTN5UgIc/edit#gid=1498161455), no later than **08:00AM April 5th**
4. Read the review and give a short feedback to the review directly in the spreadsheet. Was the criticism you got fair, valid and/or helpful?
